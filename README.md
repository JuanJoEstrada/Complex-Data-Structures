# Complex Data Structures
This code aims to gain a deeper understanding of the data structure rather than creating a production-quality data structure.

## 1 Hash Maps
One of the most efficient data structures when it comes to retrieving stored data. Use it when you need to store and retrieve data. You can see that it combines arrays and linked lists.

## 2 Trees
Tree data structures are built using tree nodes (a variation of Node used on Linear Data Structures Repository) and are another way of storing information. Specifically, trees are used for data that has a hierarchical structure, such as a family tree or a computer's file system. The tree data structure I am going to create is an excellent foundation for further variations on trees, including AVL trees, red-black trees and binary trees. It reminds me of indexes from SQL.
