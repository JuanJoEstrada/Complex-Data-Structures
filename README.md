# Complex Data Structures
This code aims to gain a deeper understanding of the data structure rather than creating a production-quality data structure.

## 1 Hash Maps
One of the most efficient data structures when it comes to retrieving stored data. Use it when you need to store and retrieve data. You can see that it combines arrays and linked lists.

## 2 Trees
Tree data structures are built using tree nodes (a variation of Node used on Linear Data Structures Repository) and are another way of storing information. Specifically, trees are used for data that has a hierarchical structure, such as a family tree or a computer's file system. The tree data structure I am going to create is an excellent foundation for further variations on trees, including AVL trees, red-black trees and binary trees. It reminds me of indexes from SQL.

## 3 Heaps
Heaps are another variation of the tree data structure and are adept at keeping track of the maximum or minimum value held within, referred to as max-heaps and min-heaps, respectively. Specifically, heaps are a type of binary tree, since each child node is either greater or less than its parent (depending on if it’s a max-heap or min-heap). They are efficient for accessing the root value, which will either be the max or min (again, depending on the type of heap) and inserting new values.
Heaps enable solutions for complex problems such as finding the shortest path (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) or efficiently sorting a dataset (heapsort).

## 4 Graphs
Graphs are used to represent data points, or vertices, that are connected by edges. Common applications for graphs are things like maps, where each location is a vertex, and each path, or road, between the locations is an edge. Graphs can be directed (a one-way street) or undirected (a two-way street), as well as weighted or unweighted (think of the length of each street as a potential measurement of weight).
